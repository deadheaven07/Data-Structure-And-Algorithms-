Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms are foundational concepts in computer science, essential for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for learners at all levels, whether you're a beginner looking to understand basic concepts or an experienced developer seeking to deepen your knowledge and skills.

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java from the official Java website.

Topics Covered
This repository covers a wide range of topics in Data Structures and Algorithms, including but not limited to:

Basic Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.
Dynamic Programming
Graph Algorithms: Shortest Paths, Minimum Spanning Trees, Network Flow, etc.
Advanced Data Structures: Heaps, Hash Tables, Trie, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, etc.
Each topic includes detailed explanations, Java code implementations, and exercises to practice your skills.

Usage
You can navigate through the repository to find the topics you're interested in. Each topic is organized into its own directory and includes relevant files such as Java source code, READMEs, and example inputs/outputs.
